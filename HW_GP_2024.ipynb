    "The problem is the prediction of both the heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of residential buildings. We consider eight input variables for each building: relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution.\n",

    "In this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877881200151X) you can find a detailed description of the problem and a solution based on linear regression [(iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=10&ved=2ahUKEwjZuoLY2OjgAhUs3uAKHUZ7BVcQFjAJegQIAhAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpdfs.semanticscholar.org%2F9b92%2F18e7233f4d0b491e1582c893c9a099470a73.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3YDwqZh1xyF626VqfnCM2k) and random forests. Using GPs, our goal is not only estimate accurately both HL and CL, but also get a measure of uncertainty in our predictions.\n",
